# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root
- **`docs/adr/`**: read ADRs that touch the area you are about to work in

If any of these files do not exist, **proceed silently**. Do not flag their absence; do not suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill (reached via `/grill-with-docs` and `/improve-codebase-architecture`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo:

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
│   ├── 2023-01-01-neo4j-graph-database.md
│   └── ...
└── apps/  packages/  scripts/
```

## Use the glossary vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need is not in the glossary yet, that is a signal: either you are inventing language the project does not use (reconsider) or there is a real gap (note it for `/domain-modeling`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR 2026-07-22-audit-log-design (audit log design), but worth reopening because..._
